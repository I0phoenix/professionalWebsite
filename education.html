        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>
            Currently, I am working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity at Penn State University. I am
            expecting to graduate some time in the 2025-2026 school year. I currently have a 3.58 GPA.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I first came to Penn State, I was pursuing a Computer Engineering degree. As a result of this, I have
            taken classes covering Python, Java, SQL, HTML, and working with AWS servers. After switching my major to
            Cybersecurity, I am taking classes covering web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), SQL (more in depth
            than in previous classes) and databases, and network fundamentals.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I am not far into my degree, I am very much looking forward to future classes, including cyber defense,
            malware analysis, cyber forensics, and cybersecurity analytics.
