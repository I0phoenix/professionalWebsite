        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>
            While I may not have much experience in the Cybersecurity field as of now, I do have valuable experience in
            other areas. My parents own a preschool, where I spent summers helping out in various classrooms along with
            assisting in cleaning. At 18, I was responsible for a classroom of my own, ensuring children stayed safe and
            engaged.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to this, I helped my dad in his company. I was responsible for editing videos for his YouTube channel
            as well as posting them. In addition, I helped him keep track of appointments and emails.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my sophmore year of college, I took a position through Penn State Wilkes-Barre as a part-time tutor. Here,
            I helped students understand topics such as physics, calculus, and computer science. I also helped to track
            Learning Center Activity via a spreadsheet.
        </p>

            In addition, during my time in college I served as both the secretary and later the president of the Nerd Herd. I was
            responsible for things like running meetings, taking notes, and keeping track of paperwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the summer of 2023 I was back at Kids Play, this time as the tech specialist. I helped investigate programs
            to increase employee communication, made social media posts, kept track of passwords of devices for both teacher
            and student use, and create a website design for the company website.
        </p>
        <p>
            This summer, I plan to find a place that will let me expand on the knowledge I've gained in my classes. In addition,
            I plan to use the time I have this summer to further learn about and investigate Linux and participate in cybersecurity
            related challenges, such as capture the flag and hackathons.
