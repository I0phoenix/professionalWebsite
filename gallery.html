        <h1>Horse Photos</h1>
        <p>
            One of my favorite hobbies outside of the tech world is hanging out with horses. Here are some of my favorite
            higlights:

            My first time driving horses, accompanied by my boyfriend! Bess (on the right) and Pansy (on the left)
            were very good for me.
        </p>

            My first horse driving competition. I took 3rd! Bess is such a good girl.

            This is what happens when the Belgian you're most likely to ride is also the biggest in the barn. This is Bones.

            This is Reno. He's a Thoroughbred. And while he may belong to my boyfriend's family, he is absolutely ny baby.
            And the horse I get to ride.
        </p>

            If you ask your boyfriend to go riding with you, and you only have one horse, he's going to want to ride too.
            At least he loves Reno as much as I do!!
